## Kinda sus?

Do you feel like you already seen this extension before? Well, you are right, this is a direct copy of an unpublished extension a friend of mine made, he, however, didn't have the time or the will to maintain it, so I took it upon myself to do it, and here we are.

I'll do my best to keep this extension up to date and add new features, but I'm not a VSCode extension developer, so I'll have to learn as I go. If you have any suggestions, please, open an issue or a pull request.

I had to change the name of the extension because the original name was already taken, and I couldn't publish it with the same name. I also had to change the name of the extension folder, so if you had the original extension installed, you'll have to uninstall it and install this one. Sorry for the inconvenience.
